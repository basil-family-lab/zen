  hero:
    heading: "I help people in difficult situations they didn’t choose — but have to navigate."
    body: "When conversations matter and things feel tense, stuck, or unclear, situational clarity can restore agency and open new pathways forward."
  moment:
    heading: "The moment you’re in"
    paragraphs:
      - "You might be thinking about a conversation where how you show up really matters."
      - "Or replaying one that didn’t land and noticing that familiar tightening — again."
      - "Often, it’s not a lack of effort, care, or competence. It’s that the usual ways of pushing through, explaining better, or waiting it out aren’t working anymore."
      - "This is where slowing down — without disengaging — can make a real difference."
  situations:

        paragraphs:
          - "There’s a conversation coming up that matters, or one that already happened and left you unsettled."
          - "It might be with a partner, colleague, manager, teammate, or co-parent."
          - "You want to enter the conversation more grounded, understand what actually happened, and leave with greater agency — not just relief."
      - subheading: "Conversations that tighten or shift in the moment"
        lines:
          - "A meeting tightens."
          - "A comment starts landing differently."
          - "The tone shifts, and your options narrow."
        trailing_paragraph: "You want to recognize what’s happening as it’s happening — and respond in a way that keeps you aligned, present, and resourced."
      - subheading: "Navigating ongoing change or stuck dynamics"
        paragraphs:
          - "It’s not just one moment — it’s the pattern."
        lines:
          - "A team navigating ongoing change and resistance."
          - "A relationship that keeps circling the same tension."
          - "A situation where you keep adapting, but nothing really shifts."
        trailing_paragraph: "You want to change how you’re engaging with the situation so new movement becomes possible — with more agency, clarity, and choice."
    closing_emphasis: "I can support you in doing that."
  how_we_work:
    heading: "How we work together"
    paragraphs:
      - "Sessions are one-on-one and focused on the specific situation you’re navigating."
      - "The work is structured, but responsive — oriented around what’s actually happening rather than following a preset sequence."
      - "Depending on the situation, I may draw on tools, assessments, or practical lenses to support clarity and decision-making."
      - "People typically work with me for a small set of sessions, with the aim of increasing agency and creating movement you can carry forward on your own."
