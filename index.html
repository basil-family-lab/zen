      <h1>I help people in difficult situations they didn’t choose — but have to navigate.</h1>
      <p>
        When conversations matter and things feel tense, stuck, or unclear, situational clarity can restore agency and open new pathways forward.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>The moment you’re in</h2>
      <p>You might be thinking about a conversation you don’t want to get wrong.</p>
      <p>Or replaying one that didn’t land and wondering what you missed.</p>
      <p>Or noticing that familiar tightening as things start to strain — again.</p>

      <p>
        Often, it’s not a lack of effort, care, or competence.
        It’s that the usual ways of pushing through, explaining better, or waiting it out aren’t working anymore.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is where slowing down — without disengaging — can make a real difference.
      </p>

      <h2>Situations may include</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>Preparing for — or learning from — a difficult conversation</h3>
        <p>
          There’s a conversation coming up that matters, or one that already happened and left you unsettled.
        </p>
        <p>
          It might be with a partner, colleague, manager, teammate, or co-parent.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>entering the conversation more grounded</li>
          <li>understanding what actually happened</li>
          <li>following up with more clarity</li>
          <li>leaving the situation with greater agency, not just relief</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Conversations are becoming tense or strained — sometimes unexpectedly</h3>
        <p>A meeting tightens.</p>
        <p>A comment starts landing differently.</p>
        <p>The tone shifts, and your options narrow.</p>
        <p>
          You want to recognize what’s happening as it’s happening — and respond in a way that keeps you aligned, present, and resourced.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Resetting a frustrating dynamic that keeps repeating</h3>
        <p>It’s not just one moment — it’s the pattern.</p>
        <p>
          A team navigating ongoing change and resistance.
          A relationship that keeps circling the same tension.
          A situation where you keep adapting, but nothing really shifts.
        </p>
        <p>
          This work focuses on what you can change — your stance, perception, and available options —
          so new movement becomes possible without force.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How we work together</h2>
      <p>Sessions are one-on-one, structured, and adaptive.</p>
      <p>
        People typically work with me for a small set of sessions, depending on the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We work directly with what you’re navigating — paying attention to your thinking,
        your body, and the relational space around you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I may introduce tools, assessments, or lenses when they’re useful.
        Nothing is prepackaged or prescribed, and additional support can be available when it makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        The focus throughout is clarity, agency, and practical movement forward.
      </p>

      <h2>What this is — and is not</h2>

      <h3>This is:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>practical support for real situations</li>
        <li>a way to slow down without disengaging</li>
        <li>work that increases agency and options</li>
        <li>grounded, relational, and immediately applicable</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>This is not:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>therapy</li>
        <li>advice-giving</li>
        <li>performance coaching</li>

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a certified Zen Leadership coach and instructor with the
        <a href="https://zenleader.global" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Institute of Zen Leadership
        </a>,
        and the founder of
        <a href="https://mindset.dojo.center" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Mindset Dojo
        </a>,
        a self-inquiry and presence-based practice community.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience spans decades in business and technology, working in complex environments
        and periods of change, alongside lived experience navigating leadership, teams, and co-parenting.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m also a student of Aikido, practicing alongside my children.
        That practice — working with energy, timing, and balance rather than force —
        quietly informs how I approach difficult situations and conversations.

      <h2>What people have said</h2>

      <article>
        <h3>Business &amp; technology leader navigating change</h3>
        <p>
          “As things shifted around me, I felt increasingly constrained.
          By changing how I saw the situation — and how I showed up —
          I regained a sense of agency and choice.
          What felt stuck became workable.”
        </p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Emerging leader preparing for interviews</h3>
        <p>
          “We aligned my resume with how I articulated my experience for different audiences.
          I stopped performing and started speaking coherently about what I bring.
          That clarity changed how I showed up — and how I was received.”
        </p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>Co-parent navigating ongoing tension</h3>
        <p>
          “The tone of our conversations shifted in ways I didn’t expect.
          There’s less friction now, more clarity,
          and we’re able to negotiate without things escalating.”
