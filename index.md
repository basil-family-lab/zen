# I help people in difficult situations they didn’t choose — but have to navigate.

When conversations matter and things feel tense, stuck, or unclear, situational clarity can restore agency and open new pathways forward.

## The moment you’re in

You might be thinking about a conversation you don’t want to get wrong.  
Or replaying one that didn’t land and wondering what you missed.  
Or noticing that familiar tightening as things start to strain — again.

Often, it’s not a lack of effort, care, or competence. It’s that the usual ways of pushing through, explaining better, or waiting it out aren’t working anymore.

This is where slowing down — without disengaging — can make a real difference.

## Situations may include

### Preparing for — or learning from — a difficult conversation

There’s a conversation coming up that matters, or one that already happened and left you unsettled.  
It might be with a partner, colleague, manager, teammate, or co-parent.

- entering the conversation more grounded
- understanding what actually happened
- following up with more clarity
- leaving the situation with greater agency, not just relief

### Conversations are becoming tense or strained — sometimes unexpectedly

A meeting tightens.  
A comment starts landing differently.  
The tone shifts, and your options narrow.

You want to recognize what’s happening as it’s happening — and respond in a way that keeps you aligned, present, and resourced.

### Resetting a frustrating dynamic that keeps repeating

It’s not just one moment — it’s the pattern.

A team navigating ongoing change and resistance.  
A relationship that keeps circling the same tension.  
A situation where you keep adapting, but nothing really shifts.

This work focuses on what you can change — your stance, perception, and available options — so new movement becomes possible without force.

## How we work together

Sessions are one-on-one, structured, and adaptive.  
People typically work with me for a small set of sessions, depending on the situation.

We work directly with what you’re navigating — paying attention to your thinking, your body, and the relational space around you.

I may introduce tools, assessments, or lenses when they’re useful. Nothing is prepackaged or prescribed, and additional support can be available when it makes sense.

The focus throughout is clarity, agency, and practical movement forward.

## What this is — and is not

### This is:

- practical support for real situations
- a way to slow down without disengaging
- work that increases agency and options
- grounded, relational, and immediately applicable

### This is not:

- therapy
- advice-giving
- performance coaching
- fixing other people

## About me

I’m a certified Zen Leadership coach and instructor with the [Institute of Zen Leadership](https://zenleader.global), and the founder of [Mindset Dojo](https://mindset.dojo.center), a self-inquiry and presence-based practice community.

My experience spans decades in business and technology, working in complex environments and periods of change, alongside lived experience navigating leadership, teams, and co-parenting.

I’m also a student of Aikido, practicing alongside my children. That practice — working with energy, timing, and balance rather than force — quietly informs how I approach difficult situations and conversations.

## What people have said

### Business & technology leader navigating change

“As things shifted around me, I felt increasingly constrained. By changing how I saw the situation — and how I showed up — I regained a sense of agency and choice. What felt stuck became workable.”

### Emerging leader preparing for interviews

“We aligned my resume with how I articulated my experience for different audiences. I stopped performing and started speaking coherently about what I bring. That clarity changed how I showed up — and how I was received.”

### Co-parent navigating ongoing tension

“The tone of our conversations shifted in ways I didn’t expect. There’s less friction now, more clarity, and we’re able to negotiate without things escalating.”
