  <h1>I help people in difficult situations they didn’t choose — but have to navigate.</h1>

  <p>
    When conversations matter and things feel tense, stuck, or unclear,
    situational clarity can restore agency and open new pathways forward.

<section id="moment">
  <h2>The moment you’re in</h2>

  <p>
    You might be thinking about a conversation where how you show up really matters.
  </p>

  <p>
    Or replaying one that didn’t land and noticing that familiar tightening — again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Often, it’s not a lack of effort, care, or competence.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s that the usual ways of pushing through, explaining better, or waiting it out
    aren’t working anymore.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is where slowing down — without disengaging — can make a real difference.
  </p>

<section id="situations">
  <h2>Situations may include</h2>

  <h3>Preparing for — or learning from — a consequential conversation</h3>

  <p>
    There’s a conversation coming up that matters, or one that already happened
    and left you unsettled.
  </p>

  <p>
    It might be with a partner, colleague, manager, teammate, or co-parent.
  </p>

  <p>
    You want to enter the conversation more grounded,
    understand what actually happened,
    and leave with greater agency — not just relief.
  </p>

  <h3>Conversations that tighten or shift in the moment</h3>

  <p>
    A meeting tightens.
  </p>

  <p>
    A comment starts landing differently.
  </p>

  <p>
    The tone shifts, and your options narrow.
  </p>

  <p>
    You want to recognize what’s happening as it’s happening —
    and respond in a way that keeps you aligned, present, and resourced.
  </p>

  <h3>Navigating ongoing change or stuck dynamics</h3>

  <p>
    It’s not just one moment — it’s the pattern.
  </p>

  <p>
    A team navigating ongoing change and resistance.
  </p>

  <p>
    A relationship that keeps circling the same tension.
  </p>

  <p>
    A situation where you keep adapting, but nothing really shifts.
  </p>

  <p>
    You want to change how you’re engaging with the situation
    so new movement becomes possible —
    with more agency, clarity, and choice.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>I can support you in doing that.</em>

<section id="how-we-work">
  <h2>How we work together</h2>

  <p>
    Sessions are one-on-one and focused on the specific situation you’re navigating.
  </p>

  <p>
    The work is structured, but responsive —
    oriented around what’s actually happening
    rather than following a preset sequence.
  </p>

  <p>
    Depending on the situation, I may draw on tools, assessments,
    or practical lenses to support clarity and decision-making.
  </p>

  <p>
    People typically work with me for a small set of sessions,
    with the aim of increasing agency
    and creating movement you can carry forward on your own.

    <li>work that increases agency and available options</li>
    <li>grounded, immediately applicable clarity</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>This is not:</h3>
