# I help people in difficult situations they didn’t choose — but have to navigate.

When conversations matter and things feel tense, stuck, or unclear, situational clarity can restore agency and open new pathways forward.

## The moment you’re in

You might be thinking about a conversation you don’t want to get wrong.  
Or replaying one that didn’t land and noticing that familiar tightening — again.

Often, it’s not a lack of effort, care, or competence. It’s that the usual ways of pushing through, explaining better, or waiting it out aren’t working anymore.

This is where slowing down — without disengaging — can make a real difference.

## Situations may include

### Preparing for — or learning from — a consequential conversation

There’s a conversation coming up that matters, or one that already happened and left you unsettled.

It might be with a partner, colleague, manager, teammate, or co-parent.

You want to enter the conversation more grounded, understand what actually happened, and leave with greater agency — not just relief.

### Conversations that tighten or shift in the moment

A meeting tightens.  
A comment starts landing differently.  
The tone shifts, and your options narrow.

You want to recognize what’s happening as it’s happening — and respond in a way that keeps you aligned, present, and resourced.

### Navigating ongoing change or stuck dynamics

It’s not just one moment — it’s the pattern.

A team navigating ongoing change and resistance.  
A relationship that keeps circling the same tension.  
A situation where you keep adapting, but nothing really shifts.

You want to change how you’re engaging with the situation so new movement becomes possible — with more agency, clarity, and choice.

## How we work together

Sessions are one-on-one and focused on the specific situation you’re navigating.

The work is structured, but responsive — we orient around what’s actually happening rather than following a preset sequence.

Depending on the situation, I may draw on tools, assessments, or practical lenses to support clarity and decision-making.

People typically work with me for a small set of sessions, with the aim of increasing agency and creating movement you can carry forward on your own.

## What this is — and is not

### This is:

- support for real, high-stakes situations  
- work that increases agency and available options  
- grounded, immediately applicable clarity  

### This is not:

- therapy  
- advice-giving  
- fixing other people  

## About me

I’m a certified Zen Leadership coach and instructor with the [Institute of Zen Leadership](https://zenleader.global), and the founder of [Mindset Dojo](https://mindset.dojo.center), a self-inquiry and presence-based practice community.

My experience spans decades in business and technology, working in complex environments and periods of change, alongside lived experience navigating leadership, teams, and co-parenting.

## What people have said

### Business & technology leader navigating ongoing change

“As things shifted around me, I felt increasingly constrained. By changing how I saw the situation — and how I showed up — I regained a sense of agency and choice. What felt stuck became workable.”

### Emerging leader preparing for high-stakes interviews

“We aligned my resume with how I articulated my experience for different audiences. I stopped performing and started speaking coherently about what I bring. That clarity changed how I showed up — and how I was received.”

### Co-parent navigating an ongoing tension dynamic

“The tone of our conversations shifted in ways I didn’t expect. There’s less friction now, more clarity, and we’re able to negotiate without things escalating.”
