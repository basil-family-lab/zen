    I help parents change how they show up in ongoing co-parenting situations
    when the pattern isn’t working, the stakes are real, and walking away
    isn’t an option.

  heading: This isn’t about winning
  paragraphs:
    - >
      Co-parenting conflict doesn’t resolve itself with time. It resolves when
      someone changes how they participate in the system.
    - >
      This work is for people who are no longer willing to stay trapped in
      reactive cycles — even when the other parent may never change.

situations:
  heading: You might recognize yourself here
  items:
    - subheading: The same conversations keep repeating
      paragraphs:
        - >
          You’ve had versions of the same discussion many times.
          It escalates, shuts down, or drifts — and nothing actually changes.
    - subheading: You leave interactions drained or unsettled
      paragraphs:
        - >
          Even when nothing dramatic happens, the emotional cost is high.
          You replay conversations or brace for the next one.
    - subheading: You want to protect your children without escalating conflict
      paragraphs:
        - >
          You care about long-term stability more than short-term validation,
          but you’re not sure how to shift the dynamic without making things worse.
  closing_emphasis: >
    This work starts with what you can control — your preparation,
    your responses, and your choices over time.

how_we_work:
  heading: How we work together
  paragraphs:
    - >
      This is one-on-one work focused on preparation, regulation,
      and deliberate response — not fixing or managing the other parent.
    - >
      We work with real upcoming conversations, recurring situations,
      and the emotional patterns that tend to hijack them.
    - >
      The goal is not false harmony. The goal is increased agency and stability
      inside a system you are already part of.
