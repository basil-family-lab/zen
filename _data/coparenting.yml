  heading: Co-Parenting When the Dynamic Is Stuck
  body: >
    I help parents change how they show up in high-conflict co-parenting situations,
    even when the other parent may never change.
    The work focuses on increasing your agency,
    reducing unnecessary escalation,
    and creating more stability for you and your children.

moment:
  heading: This isn’t about winning
  paragraphs:
    - >
      Co-parenting conflict doesn’t resolve itself with time.
      Patterns tend to harden, reactions intensify,
      and conversations start to feel more brittle and charged.
    - >
      This work is for parents who want to interrupt those patterns —
      even when cooperation is limited,
      and even when the other parent may not participate
      in the change you’re making.

situations:
  heading: You might recognize yourself here
  items:
    - subheading: The same conversations keep repeating
      paragraphs:
        - >
          You revisit the same topics again and again,
          hoping this time the outcome will be different —
          but it rarely is.
    - subheading: Interactions leave you drained or on edge
      paragraphs:
        - >
          You prepare carefully, yet still walk away feeling reactive,
          misunderstood, or emotionally exhausted.
    - subheading: You’re trying to protect your children without escalating things
      paragraphs:
        - >
          You want consistency and stability for your kids,
          while avoiding dynamics that make everything feel more adversarial.
    - subheading: Court feels like it’s always in the background
      paragraphs:
        - >
          Even when you’re not in court,
          it can feel like it’s only one bad interaction away.
        - >
          You’re curious whether there’s another way
          to shift the pattern before things escalate further.
  closing_emphasis: >
    This work starts with what you can control —
    how you prepare, respond, and show up inside the system you’re already in.

how_we_work:
  heading: How we work together
  paragraphs:
    - >
      This is one-on-one work with real conversations and current situations.
      We work with what is actually happening —
      the interactions you’re already in
      and the patterns that tend to take over when the stakes are high.

      The goal is not false harmony.
      The goal is increased agency and stability over time —
      reducing the likelihood of court involvement,
      expensive mediation,
      and ongoing conflict that pulls energy away from your family.

  intro: >
    If this resonates, the work is typically done in a focused engagement
    of three, five, or ten one-on-one virtual sessions.
    The number depends on the complexity of the situation
    and what you’re trying to stabilize or change.
    
    The next step is a free discovery consultation.
    In that conversation, we’ll look at your current situation,
    clarify what you want to change,
    and determine together whether this work is a good fit —
    and if so, what a reasonable scope would be.
    
    There’s no obligation.
