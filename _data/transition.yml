  body: >
    I help people regain clarity and agency during professional transition —
    especially after disruption they didn’t choose.
    The work focuses on reducing confusion,
    concentrating your energy,
    and moving forward deliberately instead of reactively.

moment:
  heading: This isn’t about rushing
  paragraphs:
    - >
      Transition often comes with a flood of advice —
      much of it projected from what worked for someone else
      ten or even twenty years ago,
      in a very different market and context.
    - >
      At the same time, feedback cycles can be slow and uneven.
      It’s hard to know whether something isn’t working,
      or whether you simply haven’t received a signal yet.
      Without clarity, effort can quickly become fragmented and draining.

situations:
  heading: You might recognize yourself here
  items:
    - subheading: You’re getting a lot of advice, but very little signal
      paragraphs:
        - >
          Well-meaning people offer suggestions,
          yet much of it feels outdated,
          mismatched,
          or disconnected from how hiring actually works today.
    - subheading: There are too many possible directions
      paragraphs:
        - >
          Different roles, industries, and paths are available,
          but it’s hard to tell which ones are actually worth investing in —
          especially when signals arrive slowly or inconsistently.
    - subheading: Your resume doesn’t reflect who you are now
      paragraphs:
        - >
          You know you’ve grown,
          but your resume — or set of resumes —
          still anchors you to an earlier version of yourself.
    - subheading: Traditional approaches aren’t helping you gain traction
      paragraphs:
        - >
          Career placement and generic job-search advice
          tend to be cookie-cutter.
          They rarely help you clarify where your energy fits best
          or how to differentiate yourself once you’re in the process.
  closing_emphasis: >
    This work treats clarity as the top priority —
    so effort and opportunity start to align
    instead of becoming fragmented and frayed.

  paragraphs:

      This is one-on-one work with real decisions and real constraints.
      We focus on your current situation
      and the choices directly in front of you.

      We often use your resume — or a small set of resumes —
      as a working surface.
      Not just to improve them,
      but to clarify intention,
      identify where your energy is strongest,
      and understand how your story lands in different contexts.
    - >
      The goal is not to chase every option.
      The goal is to identify a strong cluster of roles or directions,
      focus your energy there,
      and engage the process with steadiness and confidence.

      If this resonates, the work is typically done in a focused engagement
      of five or ten one-on-one virtual sessions.
      The number depends on the complexity of the transition
      and what you’re trying to clarify or change.

      The next step is a free discovery consultation.
      In that conversation, we’ll look at your current situation,
      clarify what you’re aiming for,
      and determine together whether this work is a good fit —
      and if so, what a reasonable scope would be.
