    when the old story no longer fits and rushing forward would be a mistake.

  heading: Transition exposes how you decide
  paragraphs:
    - >
      Transition isn’t just a gap between roles. It’s a period where
      familiar signals disappear and decision-making gets harder.
    - >
      This work is for people who want to move forward deliberately,
      not reactively — and who are willing to slow down long enough
      to see what’s actually emerging.

          You feel urgency from finances, identity, or external expectations,

  heading: How we work together

      and preparation — as instruments for clarity, not performance theater.

      The focus is on pattern recognition, energy investment,
      and choosing paths you can stand behind.

      This is not about speed. It’s about direction and integrity
      in how you move forward.
