    Conflict Conversations (in development) is a 
    one-on-one, recorded conversation
    that becomes a published podcast episode.
    Each conversation uses a real situation
    to surface patterns, language,
    and decision dynamics around conflict —
    with the aim of improving clarity and agency
    in how people act going forward.

moment:
  heading: When clarity becomes critical to improving the situation
  paragraphs:
    - >
      In complex or high-stakes situations,
      people often act before they fully understand
      what’s actually driving the conflict.
    - >
      Conflict Conversations creates space
      to examine a situation carefully,
      so decisions and actions going forward
      are more deliberate and less reactive.

participants:
  heading: Who this is for
  paragraphs:
    - >
      Conflict Conversations is for people willing to examine
      a real situation publicly
      in a one-on-one recorded conversation.
    - >
      Guests may be unpacking a past situation
      or preparing for one they can clearly name.
      Participants may use first names or alternative names
      to preserve privacy if they choose.
      This is not appropriate for moments of acute crisis.
