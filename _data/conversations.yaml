    Conflict Conversations is a public, recorded inquiry
    using real situations to surface patterns, language,
    and decision dynamics around conflict.
    The aim is improved clarity and agency —
    so people can act more deliberately
    in how they show up going forward.

moment:
  heading: When understanding becomes critical to improving the situation
  paragraphs:
    - >
      In complex or high-stakes situations,
      action often happens before understanding has fully formed.
    - >
      Conflict Conversations exists for moments
      when better clarity is necessary
      to improve how decisions are made
      and how people choose to engage.

participants:
  heading: Who this is for
  paragraphs:
    - >
      Conflict Conversations is for people willing to examine
      a real situation publicly,
      with enough distance and composure
      to reflect on patterns rather than argue positions.
    - >
      Guests may be unpacking a past situation
      or preparing for one they can clearly name.
      Participants may use first names or alternative names
      to preserve privacy if they choose.
      This is not appropriate for moments of acute crisis.
