  heading: Engagements for Situations That Need Clarity
  body: >
    This page describes how this work is typically done.
    Each engagement is designed to support clearer judgment
    and more deliberate action inside real, present situations —
    without requiring certainty, compliance, or change from others.

  paragraphs:

      Most people arrive here in the middle of something:
      a situation that feels tense, constrained, or hard to read.
      The question is not whether the situation matters,
      but how much support is actually helpful —
      whether that means getting oriented in a specific moment
      or working with patterns that unfold over time.

      paragraphs:
        - >
          This session is for situations where clarity is needed now,
          but ongoing work may or may not be necessary.
        - >
          You are introduced to a practical sense-making tool
          drawn from the Zen Leadership toolkit (FEBI®),
          and we apply it directly to a specific situation you are navigating.
        - >
          The focus is on understanding:
          how you are showing up,
          how others are likely experiencing you,
          and what choices are realistically available.
        - >
          Many people use this session to orient themselves,
          apply what they learn,
          and decide later whether further support would be useful.

        duration: 60–90 minutes per session
      paragraphs:

          Some situations do not resolve in a single conversation.
          Patterns repeat,
          relationships persist,
          or pressure accumulates over time.
        - >
          This engagement supports working with those conditions
          across multiple conversations as they unfold.
        - >
          The primary sense-making lens is deepened through use,
          and additional tools are introduced as needed,
          always in service of steadier judgment under pressure.

    What makes sense depends on the nature of the situation
    and how much continuity is needed to stabilize or shift it.
