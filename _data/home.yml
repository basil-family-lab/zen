    I help people navigate situations where the stakes are real

    The work focuses on restoring agency,
    reducing unnecessary escalation,
    and helping you move forward deliberately.

  heading: When advice isn’t helping
  paragraphs:
    - >
      In moments of disruption or conflict,
      it’s common to receive a lot of advice —
      much of it conflicting, outdated,
      or disconnected from your reality.
    - >
      What’s usually missing isn’t effort or intelligence,
      but clarity about how to move forward
      from where you actually are.
