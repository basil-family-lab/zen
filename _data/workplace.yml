  heading: Workplace Conflict When the Situation Is Stuck
  body: >
    I help professionals navigate ongoing workplace conflict
    where the stakes are real and the path forward isn’t obvious —
    even when other people involved may never change.
    The work focuses on increasing your agency,
    reducing unnecessary escalation,
    and helping you act with clarity inside the system you’re already in.

moment:
  heading: This isn’t about winning
  paragraphs:
    - >
      Workplace conflict rarely resolves itself on its own.
      Patterns tend to repeat,
      conversations become more constrained,
      and tension accumulates beneath the surface.
    - >
      This work is for people who want to interrupt those patterns —
      even when power dynamics are uneven,
      incentives are misaligned,
      or escalation feels risky.

situations:
  heading: You might recognize yourself here
  items:
    - subheading: The same conversations keep circling without resolution
      paragraphs:
        - >
          You revisit the same topics in meetings or one-on-ones,
          hoping for movement —
          but the outcome stays largely the same.
    - subheading: Interactions leave you guarded or on edge
      paragraphs:
        - >
          You prepare carefully,
          yet still walk away feeling constrained,
          reactive,
          or unsure how your actions are being interpreted.
    - subheading: You’re accountable without full authority
      paragraphs:
        - >
          You’re responsible for outcomes,
          but don’t control all the levers that shape them.
    - subheading: Escalation feels costly
      paragraphs:
        - >
          Involving HR, leadership, or formal processes
          feels like it could create new problems —
          even if the current situation isn’t sustainable.
        - >
          You’re wondering whether there’s a way
          to shift the pattern before things harden further.
  closing_emphasis: >
    This work starts with what you can control —
    how you prepare,
    how you respond,
    and how you choose to engage inside the system you’re part of.

how_we_work:
  heading: How we work together
  paragraphs:
    - >
      This is one-on-one work grounded in real situations.
      We work with current interactions,
      organizational context,
      and the patterns that tend to take over when stakes are high.

      The goal is not false harmony.
      The goal is clearer judgment,
      increased agency,
      and more deliberate action over time —
      reducing unnecessary escalation
      and preserving credibility and stability.

          I’m able to prepare for difficult conversations
          instead of reacting in the moment.

          It helped me see where I actually had agency
          and where I didn’t — which changed how I engaged.
